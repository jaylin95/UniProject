    //Individual Champion tips and tricks
    //Individual Champion tips and tricks
    <string name="aatrox_tips">
        - Be wary of his Q (Dark Flight) which knocks up targets, it is a fast ability but can be easily avoided by using a dash/blink ability.
        \n
        \n
        - Watch out for his passive, as he can revive after death once (look out for a white ring around him).
    </string>
    <string name="ahri_tips">
        - Her only CC is her E (Charm) which is the main ability you must dodge otherwise she will follow up with her Q (Orb of Deception)
        \n
        \n
        - Cleansable abilities: E.
        \n
        \n
        - She is very capable of roaming post 6 so keep in mind if she is missing from the mid lane.
    </string>
    <string name="akali_tips">
        - Akali pre-6 is not much threat so take advantage of this with your jungle.
        \n
        \n
        - Akali upon hitting 6 learning her ultimate (Shadow Dance) will immediately grant her 3 stacks allowing her a window of all in, be careful when she is about to hit 6.
        \n
        \n
        - Akali regains a stack of Shadow Dance immediately if she receives a kill or assist so keep that in mind and try to track how many stacks she has.
    </string>
    <string name="alistar_tips">
        - Alistar’s level 2 power spike, Q (Pulverize) and W (Headbutt) is one of the strongest for all ins, if their bot lane is about to hit level 2 first then backup and deny him the oppurtunity.
        \n
        \n
        - Once Alistar’s Q+W is down, he has no presence in lane for roughly 15-10 seconds, cool down for Q ranges from 17-13 seconds whereas cool down for W ranges from 14-10 seconds.
        \n
        \n
        - Alistar’s E (Trample) will stun you with an auto attack from 5 stacks, you can see this as there is a visual indicator for each stack.
        \n
        \n
        - Upon hitting 6 and learning his ultimate (Unbreakable Will), Alistar can tower dive with ease, keep this in mind when you sense a possible dive from the enemy team.
        \n
        \n
        - Tracking Alistars flash is extremely important as he can flash pulverise or flash Q+W combo.
    </string>
    <string name="amumu_tips">
        - Amumu’s Q (Bandage Toss) has a range of 1100 units and cool down ranges from 16-8.
        \n
        \n
        - Amumus usually does not max Q, therefore his pre 6 ganks are not that effective if you manage to dodge his Q.
        \n
        \n
        - Post 6 upon learning his ultimate (Curse of the Sad Mummy) his ganks become much stronger with an AOE entangle.
        \n
        \n
        - Tracking Amumus flash is extremely important as he can flash ult catching you off guard.
        \n
        \n
        - Ult radius is 550.
        \n
        \n
        - Cleansable abilities: Q, R.
    </string>
    <string name="anivia_tips">
        - Do not underestimate the damage of Anivia’s E (Frostbite) once you have been hit by her Q (Flash Frost) and/or R (Glacial Storm).
        \n
        \n
        - Anivia’s E (Crystallize) can easily catch you off guard so it is worth tracking the cool down of it.
        \n
        \n
        - Track Anivia’s passive (Rebirth) which has a cool down of 4 minutes.
        \n
        \n
        - Cleansable abilities: Q.
    </string>
    <string name="annie_tips">
        - Her passive (Pyromania) has a visual indicator for when it is active.
        \n
        \n
        - Cleansable abilities: Q, W , R (If passive is active)
        \n
        \n
        - Annie has a lot of burst so pay close attention to her passive.
        \n
        \n
        - Tracking Annies flash is extremely important as she can flash ult and burst you down.
        \n
        \n
        - Ult range is 600.
    </string>
    <string name="ashe_tips">
        - Staying behind minions in lane can allow you to avoid damage from her W (Volley).
        \n
        \n
        - You have a small window to trade once her W is down, cool down ranges from 15-5 seconds.
        \n
        \n
        - Once Ashe is 6 and learns her ultimate (Enchanted Crystal Arrow) she is able to hard initiate, be careful when she is about to hit 6.
        \n
        \n
        - Cleansable abilities: R.
    </string>
    <string name="aurelion_tips">
        - Aurelion Sol is capable of an effective roam as early as level 2, watch your minimal more than usual as he can single handedly win the enemies lane early on.
        \n
        \n
        - Cleansable abilities: Q (Starsurge).
        \n
        \n
        - All of Aurelion Sol’s skills are dodge able, early boots may be a good idea when playing against him.
    </string>
    <string name="azir_tips">
        - Azir’s ultimate (Emperor’s Divide) can interrupt any in-progress dashes during the charge, so either use your dashs before he lets or after.
        \n
        \n
